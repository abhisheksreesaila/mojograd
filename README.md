# mojograd
mojo + tinygrad = mojograd

Goal
- This is my attempt to learn **mojo** by implementing the priniciples of **tinygrad** as much as possible. If i am successful to an extent, then will create a PR and attempt to merge with the original tinygrad. else, will create a blogpost showcasing my learnings. 

Why?
- tinygrad wants to democratize AI by having a software to deploy on accelerators. Mojo attempting to do the same at the more deeper level. Combine both and you have a game changer.

Stretch goal
- Can I deploy this framework on a weird hardware? like a microcontroller?

## tensor
- lets start with the basics
